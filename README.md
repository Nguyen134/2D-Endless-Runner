This game was inspired by the Vector game by Nekki that I loved playing when I was a child on my first smartphone.

## Raining:

## Second chance:  
- You will notice that the game is getting faster and faster as you run through the levels. When you reach the maximum speed, you will see that the heart icon in the info barbelow is red and this means that you continue with a second chance without dying if you hit any traps.
